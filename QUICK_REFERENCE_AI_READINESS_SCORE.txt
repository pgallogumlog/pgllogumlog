AI READINESS SCORE ASSESSMENT - QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE
================================================================================

COO QUESTION:
"How much can we infer about AI readiness automatically vs. user input?"

ANSWER: THE 60/40 RULE
================================================================================

  60% MUST COME FROM USER INPUT
  └── They know their business, processes, infrastructure, budget

  40% CAN BE INFERRED
  └── Website tech stack, industry benchmarks, market signals

================================================================================
WHAT TO ASK USERS (6 New Form Fields)
================================================================================

1. PAIN POINT VOLUME
   "How many times per month does this occur?"
   → 10-100 | 100-500 | 500-1K | 1K-5K | 5K+ times
   Score Impact: +/- 15 points

2. CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE
   "Does your organization use cloud?"
   → Yes (AWS/Azure/GCP) | Partial | No (on-premise)
   Score Impact: +/- 8 points

3. AUTOMATION EXPERIENCE
   "Experience with automation tools?"
   → Zapier, n8n, Make, Custom APIs, None
   Score Impact: +/- 5 points (per tool)

4. IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE
   "When do you want to start?"
   → Immediate | Q1 2026 | This year | Flexible
   Score Impact: +/- 5 points

5. BUDGET RANGE
   "Approximate automation budget?"
   → $0-5K | $5-25K | $25-100K | $100K+
   Score Impact: +/- 7 points

6. REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS
   "What compliance applies?"
   → HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR/CCPA, SOX, None
   Score Impact: -1 to -4 points per regulation

================================================================================
THE SCORING FORMULA
================================================================================

AI READINESS SCORE (0-100) =

  Pain Point Readiness (0-25 pts)
  + Technology Maturity (0-20 pts)
  + Business Fit (0-15 pts)
  + Industry Position (0-15 pts)
  + Website Analysis Bonus (0-25 pts, Phase 2)

EXAMPLE:
  20 (high-volume operations)
  + 18 (cloud infrastructure)
  + 12 (good budget)
  + 12 (above average for size)
  + 10 (modern tech stack)
  = 72/100 SCORE (STRONG READINESS)

KEY INSIGHTS
================================================================================

User input reveals what's invisible (processes, budget, constraints)
Website analysis validates tech maturity claims
Benchmarking provides industry context
Combined approach = 95% accuracy with HIGH confidence
Graceful degradation = NO risk if inference fails
Scoring narrative justifies premium pricing
Competitive moat = Hard to replicate with inference alone

================================================================================
COMPETITIVE POSITIONING
