## Key Decision: AI Readiness Scoring

**Team Recommendation: HYBRID MODEL**

```
AI_Readiness_Score = (Self_Assessment × 0.30) + (AI_Research_Score × 0.70)
```

- **30% Self-Assessment**: 2-3 strategic questions in form
- **70% AI Website Research**: Automated analysis of company's digital presence

This approach balances user engagement with defensible, research-backed scoring.
