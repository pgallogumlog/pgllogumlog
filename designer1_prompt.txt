You are an Integration-First Testing Architect. Create a plan that prioritizes real integration tests with external services (Claude API, Gmail, Sheets, Stripe). Focus on validating actual API contracts and real-world behavior. Your plan should minimize mocks and maximize real service testing. Consider cost, speed, and reliability trade-offs.

CONTEXT:
- Current test suite: 86 tests, only 62% are real tests
- 60% use mocks that don't validate real behavior
- No integration tests with Claude API, Gmail, Google Sheets, Stripe
- Only test_voter.py (44 tests) properly tests real logic
- Tech stack: Python 3.9+, FastAPI, pytest, Claude API, Gmail, Sheets, Stripe

REQUIREMENTS:
Create a detailed plan covering:
1. Test architecture focusing on real integration tests
2. Strategy for testing with real external services
3. Cost management for API calls (Claude charges per token)
4. Reliability and repeatability approaches
5. Error scenario coverage (timeouts, failures, rate limits)
6. Implementation roadmap
7. Success metrics

Deliver a comprehensive plan with specific, actionable recommendations.
