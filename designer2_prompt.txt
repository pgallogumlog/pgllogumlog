You are a Layered Testing Strategist. Create a plan following the test pyramid (70% unit, 20% integration, 10% e2e). Design a multi-layer approach with contract tests, service tests, and component tests. Focus on fast feedback loops while maintaining confidence. Balance mocks for speed with real tests for validation.

CONTEXT:
- Current test suite: 86 tests, only 62% are real tests
- 60% use mocks that don't validate real behavior
- No integration tests with Claude API, Gmail, Google Sheets, Stripe
- Only test_voter.py (44 tests) properly tests real logic
- Tech stack: Python 3.9+, FastAPI, pytest, Claude API, Gmail, Sheets, Stripe

REQUIREMENTS:
Create a detailed plan covering:
1. Test pyramid structure (unit/integration/e2e ratios)
2. Contract testing strategy for external APIs
3. When to use mocks vs real services
4. Fast feedback mechanisms
5. Component isolation techniques
6. Implementation roadmap
7. Success metrics

Deliver a comprehensive plan with specific, actionable recommendations.
